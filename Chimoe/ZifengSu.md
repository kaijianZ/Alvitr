###I wrote prototype python files for our project. I also worked on the files getpids.py and saveimg.py after writing the prototypes of them. I didn't commit on my account because my python IDE was broken.

###Other than writing code, I also contributed in most of the presentation file and testing the code. When Prof.Krishnamoorthy's asked us to do community testing, I distributed the project to multiple private groups of my weeaboo friends in china for quality assurence.
