# Alvitr
pixiv crawler

## How to use:
python pixiv.py

the images will be downloaded to WorkingDirectory/images/20xx-xx-xx/

## Idea
This is a software that can automatically download the illustrations from pixiv.net. My program uses multi-thread to
improve the performance so it can download the top 50(except Manga) from the daily list in seconds.
